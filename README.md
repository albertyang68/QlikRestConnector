## Quick Start
Open the terminal on your computer

Do the following command:
```
npm install
```
the run:
```
node test.js
```

If you run test.js then it gives you error with lack module, then do following:
```
npm install validator
npm install concatenate-files
```

## Notice
At this point the googleAnalytics.js is useless but at later version there will
have no test.js, we are going to run googleAnalytics.js instead
